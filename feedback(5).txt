General Comments:
-----------------
Style:
1 point deducted: did not remove or comment out all pass statements.
1 point deducted: did not remove or comment out all print statements.

conflictsWith:
2 points deducted: did not properly check if days overlap. In this function,
say the days of self are TF and other is MWF. Friday is an overlapping day.
Then, the function will check that Tuesday is not in other, so it goes into
Monday, sees that Monday is not in the keys of self, and returns False despite
there being an overlap.

changeTime:
2 points deducted: should not append warnings when the time succesfully changes.
