Hi, this is Sean Wolf, looking at your Assignment A5.

At the end of this document is the output of our testing program and a table indicating
the points for each part. This grading feedback is designed to help you understand 
how you can improve your assignment. The final score will be out of 80 points.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me at srw239@cornell.edu.

Final Score: 73/80

Style (2/3):
------------

Deduction (1 point):
Did not remove all pass statements (See function college_named() in sd_utilities_dict.py)

Answers to code design Qs (11/15):
--------------------------------

Deduction (4 points):
Question 3: There should be no advantage to using a while loop in the function college_named(),
since the for loop stops executing once it finds the college with name n due to the return statement. It appears as though you answered the question in regards to the function process_line()
instead of college_named().


Functionality (60/62):
--------------------

process_line_list (22/22)

process_line_dict (18/20)

Deduction (2 points):
Checked ‘if senrolled_cn not in cdict’ within the for-loop 'for outcome in outcomes'.
This should be checked outside of the for-loop, to account for the potential additions of
later outcomes into cdict.


college_named (10/10)

menu_listing (10/10)
